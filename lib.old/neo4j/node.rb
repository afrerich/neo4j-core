    # Returns the only node of a given type and direction that is attached to this node, or nil.
    # This is a convenience method that is used in the commonly occuring situation where a node has exactly zero or one relationships of a given type and direction to another node.
    # Typically this invariant is maintained by the rest of the code: if at any time more than one such relationships exist, it is a fatal error that should generate an exception.
    #
    # This method reflects that semantics and returns either:
    # * nil if there are zero relationships of the given type and direction,
    # * the relationship if there's exactly one, or
    # * throws an exception in all other cases.
    #
    # This method should be used only in situations with an invariant as described above. In those situations, a "state-checking" method (e.g. #rel?) is not required,
    # because this method behaves correctly "out of the box."
